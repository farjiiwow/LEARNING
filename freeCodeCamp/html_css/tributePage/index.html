            Baba Saheb Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, he was
            the 14th and last child of his parents.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the son of Subedar Ramji Maloji Sakpal.
            He was Subedar in British Army. Babasaheb’s father was a follower of
            Sant Kabir and was also a well-read person.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was hardly two years old when his father
            retired from service. His mother died when he was only about six.
            Babasaheb got his early education in Bombay. Since his school days
            he realized with intense shock what it was to be an untouchable in
            India.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Dr. Ambedkar was taking his school education in Satara.
            Unfortunately, Dr. Ambedkar lost his mother. His aunt looked after
            him. Afterwards, they shifted to Bombay. Throughout his school
            education, he suffered from the curse of untouchability. His
            marriage took place after his matriculation in 1907 in an open shed
            of a market.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Dr. Ambedkar completed his graduation at Elphinston College, Bombay,
            for which he was getting a scholarship from His Highness Sayajirao
            Gaikwad of Baroda. After his graduation, he had to join Baroda
            Sansthan according to the bond. He lost his father when he was in
            Baroda, 1913 is the year when Dr. Ambedkar was selected as a scholar
            to go to U.S.A, for the higher studies. This was the turning point
            of his educational career.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            He got his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University in 1915
            and 1916 respectively. He then left for London for further studies.
            He was admitted there to the Gray’s Inn for Law and also allowed to
            prepare for the D. Sc. at the London School of Economics and
            Political Science. But he was called back to India by the Dewan of
            Baroda. Later, he got his Bar-at-Law and D.Sc. degree also. He
            studied for some time at Bonn University in Germany.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In 1916 he read an essay on ‘Castes in India — their Mechanism,
            Genesis, and Development’. In 1916, he wrote his thesis ‘National
            dividend for India — A Historic and Analytical Study’ and got his
            Ph.D. Degree. This was published after eight years under the title —
            “Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India.” Then after
            getting this highest degree, he returned to India and was appointed
            a Military Secretary to the Maharaja of Baroda with a view to groom
            him as the finance minister in the long run.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Babasaheb returned to the city in September, 1917 as his scholarship
            tenure ended and joined the service. But after a brief stay in the
            city till November, 1917, he left for Mumbai. The maltreatment he
            faced on grounds of untouchability had forced him to leave the
            service.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Dr. Ambedkar returned to Bombay and joined Sydenham College as a
            Professor of Political Economy. As he was well read, he was very
            popular among the students. But he resigned his post, to resume his
            studies in Law and Economics in London. Maharaja of Kolhapur gave
            him the financial help. In 1921, he wrote his thesis. “Provincial
            Decentralization of Imperial Finance in British India,’ and got his
            M.Sc. Degree from the London University. Then he spent some period
            in Bonn University in Germany. In 1923, he submitted his thesis —
            “Problem of Rupee its Origin and Solution”, for the D.Sc. Degree. He
            was called to Bar in 1923.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            After coming back from England in 1924 he started an Association for
            the welfare of the depressed classes, with Sir Chimanlal Setalvad as
            the President and Dr. Ambedkar as the Chairman. To spread education,
            improve economic conditions and represent the grievances of
            depressed classes were the immediate objects of the Association.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The Bahiskrit Bharat, newspaper was started in April 3, 1927 to
            address the cause of the depressed classes in view of the new
            reform.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In 1928, he became a Professor in Government Law College, Bombay and
            on June 1, 1935 he became the Principal of the same college and
            remained in that position till his resignation in 1938.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On October 13, 1935, a provincial conference of the depressed
            classes was held a Yeola in Nasik District. In this conference, he
            gave the shock to the Hindus by announcing. “I was born in Hinduism
            but I will not die as a Hindu” Thousands of his followers supported
            his decision. In 1936 he addressed the Bombay Presidency Mahar
            Conference and advocated the renunciation of Hinduism.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On August 15, 1936, he formed Independent Labour Party to safeguard
            the interest of the depressed classes, which mostly formed the
            labour population.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In 1938, Congress introduced a bill making change in the name of
            untouchables. Dr. Ambedkar criticized it. In his point of view
            changing the name is not the solution of the problem.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In 1942, he was appointed to the Executive Council of the Governor
            General of India as a Labour member, in 1946, he was elected to the
            Constituent Assembly from Bengal. At the same time he published his
            book, Who were Shudras?
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            After Independence, in 1947, he was appointed as a Minister of Law
            and Justice in Nehru’s first cabinet. But in 1951, he resigned his
            ministership, expressing his differences on the Kashmir issue,
            India’s Foreign Policy and Nehru’s Policy towards the Hindu Code
            Bill.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In 1952, Columbia University conferred upon him the degree of LL.D.
            in recognition of the work done by him in connection with the
            drafting of India’s Constitution. In 1955, he published his book
            titled Thoughts on Linguistic States.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was awarded a Doctorate on January 12, 1953, from
            Osmania University. Ultimately after 21 years, he proved true, what
            he had announced in Yeola in 1935, that “I will not die as a Hindu”.
            On 14th Oct. 1956, he embraced Buddhism in a historic ceremony in
            Nagpur and died on 6th Dec. 1956.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was conferred with the title of “Bodhisattva”
            by the Buddhist monks at “Jagatik Buddhism Council” in 1954 in
            Kathmandu, Nepal. The special thing is that Dr Ambedkar was
            conferred with the title of Bodhisattva while he was alive.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            He also contributed to India’s Independence struggle and in its
            reforms post-independence. Apart from this, Babasaheb played a
            significant role in the formation of the Reserve Bank of India. The
            Central bank was formed on the concept presented by Babasaheb to the
            Hilton Young Commission.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            This sparkling life history of Dr. Ambedkar shows that he was a man
            of study and action. Firstly, he acquired sound knowledge of
            Economics Politics, Law, Philosophy and Sociology, in pursuing his
            studies; he had to face many social odds. But he did not spend all
            his life in reading and studying and in the libraries. He refused
            the higher posts with attractive salaries because he never forgot
            his brothers in the depressed class. He dedicated the rest of his
            life for equality, brotherhood and humanity. He tried his best for
            the upliftment of the depressed classes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            After having gone through his life history it is necessary and
            proper to study and analyze his main contribution and their
            relevance. According to one opinion there are three points which are
            more important even today. Today also Indian Economy and Indian
            Society is facing many economic, and social problems. Dr. Ambedkar’s
            thoughts and actions may guide us for the solution of these
            problems.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>

            Diwas across the country.
